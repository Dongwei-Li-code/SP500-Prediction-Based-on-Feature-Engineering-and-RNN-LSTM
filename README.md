# SP500 Prediction Based on Feature Engineering and RNN(LSTM)
*   This project is the development of a notebook (code + explanation) that successfully engineers 12 unique types of features, **three** for each type of feature engineering: **transforming**, **interacting**, **mapping**, and **extracting**.
* The second part of this project is the development of a **deep learning classification** model **RNN(LSTM)** to predict the direction of the S&P500 for the dates **2018-01-01â€”2018-07-12** (test set).
